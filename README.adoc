= Docker Image with Hashicorp tools

This repository hosts the resources to build a Docker Image used for Terraform and Packer operations on the Jenkins Infrastructure.

Its goal is to provide a reproducible environment to not only run a controlled version of Terraform or Packer, but also to run infrastructure tests around terraform.
